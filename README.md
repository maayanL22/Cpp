# Cpp
some programs to enhance your  cpp skills

some nice light programs to try, i suggest trying to think alone about implementation, and if you are new to cpp, perhaps try first to search a bit about the language, the syntax, and how it works and then try to run the code and understand what it exactly does and how, and try to right your own version
the code is pretty self explanatory by the title of the files.
these programs are nice in order to understand some of the basics of the cpp language and start getting your hands dirty and also learning in order to be able to progress in order to write and develop bigger programs and projects.
enjoy :)
